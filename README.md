# Introduction to Data Visualization  

Data representation refers to the form in which you can store, process, and transmit data. Representations can narrate a story and convey fundamental discoveries to your audience. Without appropriately modeling your information to use it to make meaningful findings, its value is reduced. Creating representations helps us achieve a more precise, more concise, and more direct perspective of information, making it easier for anyone to understand the data. Information isn't equivalent to data. Representations are a useful apparatus to derive insights from the data. Thus, representations transform data into useful information. 

 **Advantages of Visualizing data** 

-Complex data can be easily understood. 

 -A simple visual representation of outliers, target audiences, and futures markets can be created 

-Storytelling can be done using dashboards and animations.  

 -Data can be explored through interactive visualizations. 

**All you need to know about plots**

  1)Comparison plots 

    -Line chart 
    -Bar chart 
    -Radar chart 
   2)Relation plots 

     -scatter 

     -Bubble 

     -Corregram 

     -heatmap 
    3)Composition plots 

     -donut/pie chart 

     -Stacked bar 

     -Stacked area chart 

    4)Venn diagram 

    5)Distribution plots 

     -Histogram 

     -Density line chart 

     -Boxplot 

     -Violin 

    6)Geoplots 

     -Dot map 

     -cheropleth map 

     -Connection map 

      

    **What makes a good Visualization?** 

    -Most importantly,your visualization should be self explanotry and Visualying appealing 

    -Your visualization should tell a story and should be designed for your audience.
